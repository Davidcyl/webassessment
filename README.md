Web Assessment (Colmar Academy)
I liked that this assessment was challenging and test the things I've learned during class and that it required me to also do my own research for things not taught.
I struggled with keeping the style code more concise as it started to accumulate when the page got longer. 
With more experience gained along the way, I would think that it will make this assessment much smoother for me. Also, If i could discuss it with team mates, It will be faster to resolve than working alone on it within the time of 5 hours, though that might defeat the purpose of the assessment haha.
